## Expectations and assessments

Much of the course is designed around group activity and discussion. Students are therefore expected to:

-   prepare for class meetings in advance by completing any assigned reading or activity;

-   attend and actively participate in class meetings and section meetings;

-   provide meaningful, timely, and concrete contributions to group activities.

Students having any difficulty in meeting these expectations should raise the issue(s) promptly with the instructor.

Qualitative feedback is emphasized over numerical scores. Students are assessed on:

-   attendance, preparation, and participation;

-   quality of submitted work;

-   individual contributions to group assignments;

-   oral interview.

## Policies

***Attendance.*** Regular attendance is expected. Each student can miss two sessions without notice; further absences may impact course grades. Students are responsible for material discussed in their absence and should review posted session notes and consult a classmate.

***Deadlines.*** Students are expected to meet assignment deadlines in a timely manner. All deadlines have a 24-hour grace period. Late or amended work may not be accepted.

***Email.*** Course staff will make their best effort to reply to email within 48 weekday hours. However, due to high volume, staff cannot guarantee that all messages will receive replies.

***Illness.*** Students who are ill are required to stay home. Students ill with COVID-19 must comply with university policy regarding reporting and quarantine. Accommodations will be made to ensure that students absent due to illness do not fall behind.

***Accommodations.*** Reasonable accommodations will be made for any student with a qualifying disability. Such requests should be made through the Disabled Students Program (DSP). More information, instructions on how to access accommodations, and information on related resources can be found on the [DSP website](https://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/). *Note: In this class, there are no timed assessments.*

***Letter grades.*** Letter grades are assigned based only on the assessments identified above and according to [university guidelines](https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/catalog/Current/AcademicPoliciesProcedures/GradingSystem.aspx), with the relative weighting of assessments determined at the discretion of the instructor. While grade calculations will not be disclosed, students are entitled to an explanation of the criteria used to determine their grades if desired. Grades will not be changed except in the case of clerical errors. If students feel their grade has been unfairly assigned, they are entitled to contest it following [UCSB procedure for contesting grades](https://my.sa.ucsb.edu/catalog/Current/AcademicPoliciesProcedures/ContestedGrades.aspx).

***Conduct.*** All course participants are expected to maintain respectful and honorable conduct consistent with [UCSB ethical standards](https://www.compliance.ucsb.edu/ethics). Students uncomfortable with the behavior of another course participant for any reason should notify the instructor, course staff, or, if the complaint relates to course staff conduct, an administrative or departmental officer. Evidence of [academic dishonesty](https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity) will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC); evidence of problematic behavior will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in accord with university policies.
