    "text": "RStudio projects\nFirst we’ll get acquainted with the basic functionality of the RStudio IDE and the use of projects as a means of organizing files. If you’ve already used RStudio, great – this will still serve to introduce you to how we’ll use RStudio projects in this class.\n\nRStudio Setup\n\nYour TA will briefly review the (default) layout of the RStudio IDE. You should be able to identify/find the following:\n\nconsole\nterminal\nfile navigator\nenvironment\nhistory\n\nWe’ll use several R packages throughout the quarter. Some of these we will install on the go, but we can install several that we’ll rely on now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAction\n\n\n\nInstall packages\nNavigate to the console and copy-paste the following commands. You only need to do this once. This will take a minute or two to complete.\n\n\n\n# package install list \nurl &lt;- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pstat197/pstat197a/main/materials/scripts/package-installs.R'\nsource(url)\n\n# clear environment\nrm(list = ls())\n\n\n\nCreate a local project\nProjects are a means of keeping your work organized. When you create a project in a directory on your local machine, RStudio keeps track of project metadata, history, and the working environment so that every time you open the project you see whatever you had open when you last closed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAction\n\n\n\nCreate a new project:\n\nSelect File &gt; New project\nCreate the project in a new directory as a subdirectory of your class folder\nName it example-project\n\nComment: when naming files it’s good practice to avoid spaces, special characters, and the like. A naming convention we try to follow: choose a descriptive name comprising 1-3 words or common abbreviations separated by hyphens.\n\n\nTake a moment to observe the file navigator. It should consist of a single example-project.Rproj file.\n\n\nAdd content\nWe may as well populate the project with a few files – so let’s add a dataset and write a short script, as if we’re just starting a data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAction\n\n\n\nRetrieve data and store a local copy\n\nOpen a new script: File &gt; New File &gt; R Script\nIn the navigator, create a folder called data and a folder called scripts\nCopy and paste the code chunk below into your script.\nExecute once, then save in the scripts folder as data-retrieval.R and close\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# retrieve pollution data\nurl &lt;- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pstat197/pstat197a/main/materials/labs/lab1-setup/data/pollution.csv'\npollution &lt;- read_csv(url)\n\n# write as csv to file\nwrite_csv(pollution, file = 'data/pollution.csv')\n\n# clear environment\nrm(list = ls())\n\n\nNext, we’ll do a simple regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAction\n\n\n\nCreate a script\n\nCreate a new script as before\nCopy-paste the code chunk below into your script\nExecute once and examine the results\nSave in the scripts folder as slr-analysis.R\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# load data\npollution &lt;- read_csv('data/pollution.csv')\n\n# examine scatterplot with SLR fit\nggplot(pollution,\n       aes(x = log(SO2), y = Mort)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# compute SLR fit\nfit &lt;- lm(Mort ~ log(SO2), data = pollution)\nbroom::tidy(fit)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    887.      17.6      50.4  1.37e-49\n2 log(SO2)        16.7      4.99      3.35 1.40e- 3\n\n# interpret\nfit_ci &lt;- confint(fit, parm = 'log(SO2)')*log(1.2)\n\npaste('With 95% confidence, every 20% increase in sulfur dioxide pollution is associated with an increase in two-year mortality rate between', \n      round(fit_ci[1], 2), \n      'and', \n      round(fit_ci[2], 2), \n      'per 100k', sep = ' ') %&gt;% \n  print()\n\n[1] \"With 95% confidence, every 20% increase in sulfur dioxide pollution is associated with an increase in two-year mortality rate between 1.23 and 4.87 per 100k\"\n\n\n\nCongrats on your first project! You can close the RStudio session now.\nWe’ll be using projects structured much like what you just set up, but with one catch: we’ll link up our RStudio projects with shared repositories so that we can all collaborate on the same set of project files."

    "text": "GitHub repositories\n\nWe will be distributing course assignments as repositories via GitHub Classroom. A repository is simply a storage space.\nHere we’ll walk you through how to access and copy the files in a repository just as you will for course assignments. The first step is to accept an assignment through a link we’ve given to you – this will create a repository for you with the files we intend for you to have.\nFor now, we’ll make a ‘group sandbox’ that you can play in during our next class meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAction\n\n\n\nAccept an assignment in GitHub Classroom\n\nFollow the link to accept the group-sandbox assignment. Since it’s a group assignment, you will be prompted to join a team.\nJoin the team for the table you sat at during last class meeting. If you don’t remember, check your attendance form receipt.\n\nYou should be directed to a team repository on github.com. You may need to refresh your browser. Keep this window open; you will need the URL.\n\n\n\nGit and GitHub\nAt some point in time – possibly quite recently – you had to install Git on your local machine, as well as create a GitHub account. So, Git and GitHub are two different things.\nGit is version control software that enables you to systematically track and control file changes within a repository – a collection of files possibly with some directory structure. (The definition of ‘repository’ is simply ‘storage place’.)\nGitHub is an online platform for hosting repositories remotely. Anyone with access to a repository can make changes to files in the repository, and this enables multiple people to collaborate on code.\n\n\nlocal &lt;&gt; remote\nUsually remote repositories are not updated directly because contributors need to execute codes to test their changes and the remote server that hosts the repository is not equipped to do this.\nInstead, contributors will prepare changes on their own machine where they can test them, and then update the remote repository once their changes are complete.\nThis process of implementing file changes in a repository involves communicating information between local and remote locations. For this purpose a local copy of the remote repository is needed.\n\n\nCloning a repository\nIn Git lingo, a clone is a local copy of a remote repository. Creating a clone copies files and establishes the link between local and remote repositories so that changes can be sent to and received from the remote repository. You only need to create a clone once.\nTo clone a repository, all one needs is:\n\nthe remote location URL;\nthe local destination where the clone will be created;\npermission from the repository owner, if private.\n\nHere you’ll clone the group sandbox repository you just created/joined. You will need the URL; if you happened to close the page when you accepted the assignment earlier, you should be able to find the repository from your home page on github.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAction\n\n\n\nClone the sandbox repository:\n\nOpen your GitHub client (GitKracken or GitHub Desktop or similar) and ensure you are logged in to your GitHub account.\nLook for a ‘Clone Repo’ menu item or similar and simply input the URL and the place you’d like to clone it; proceed through any prompts.\nCheck your file navigator to confirm that the repository files were copied.\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative possibility is to create the clone using a terminal command. In the terminal, navigate to the desired destination, and input:\ngit clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRemarks\n\n\n\nOn terminal commands:\n\nIt’s recommended to manage Git actions through a visual client, as it’s much easier to see and understand what’s happening.\nHowever, if you know exactly what you’re doing, executing simple actions via Git bash in the terminal can be more efficient at times.\nFor example, you can keep a terminal open in RStudio and manage your repository workflow from there, without having to toggle between environments.\nTry experimenting with terminal commands from RStudio after you have a little experience with basic Git actions."

    "text": "Policies\nAttendance. Regular attendance is expected. Each student can miss two sessions without notice; further absences may impact course grades. Students are responsible for material discussed in their absence and should review posted session notes and consult a classmate.\nDeadlines. Students are expected to meet assignment deadlines in a timely manner. All deadlines have a 24-hour grace period. Late or amended work may not be accepted.\nEmail. Course staff will make their best effort to reply to email within 48 weekday hours. However, due to high volume, staff cannot guarantee that all messages will receive replies.\nIllness. Students who are ill are required to stay home. Students ill with COVID-19 must comply with university policy regarding reporting and quarantine. Accommodations will be made to ensure that students absent due to illness do not fall behind.\nAccommodations. Reasonable accommodations will be made for any student with a qualifying disability. Such requests should be made through the Disabled Students Program (DSP). More information, instructions on how to access accommodations, and information on related resources can be found on the DSP website. Note: In this class, there are no timed assessments.\nLetter grades. Letter grades are assigned based only on the assessments identified above and according to university guidelines, with the relative weighting of assessments determined at the discretion of the instructor. While grade calculations will not be disclosed, students are entitled to an explanation of the criteria used to determine their grades if desired. Grades will not be changed except in the case of clerical errors. If students feel their grade has been unfairly assigned, they are entitled to contest it following UCSB procedure for contesting grades.\nConduct. All course participants are expected to maintain respectful and honorable conduct consistent with UCSB ethical standards. Students uncomfortable with the behavior of another course participant for any reason should notify the instructor, course staff, or, if the complaint relates to course staff conduct, an administrative or departmental officer. Evidence of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC); evidence of problematic behavior will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in accord with university policies.",
