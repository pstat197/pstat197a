## Before we begin...

1.  Confer with your table and choose a word of the day. Agree on spelling.

2.  Please sign in using the attendance reporting form found here:

    [https://pstat197.github.io/pstat197a/about/links.html](https://pstat197.github.io/pstat197a/about/links.html#sec-class-forms)

# General orientation

## Welcome

PSTAT197A/CMPSC190DD is the first course in UCSB's year-long data science capstone sequence.

-   ***Audience:*** undergraduate students of any discipline with a basic background in data science and an interest in research

-   ***Aim:*** prepare for an independent research or project experience

## Capstone projects

Most students are preparing for capstone projects in winter and spring. Course foci were chosen with this in mind.

-   Projects are varied ➜ emphasize problem patterns over methodology
-   Projects are collaborative ➜ emphasize teamwork and discussion
-   Projects are specialized ➜ practice independent learning based on use cases

Read about past projects at <https://centralcoastdatascience.org/projects>

## Continuing in capstones

Continuation in PSTAT197B-C/CMPSC190DE-DF during winter and spring:

-   students admitted to this course in spring have a seat;

-   students admitted from the waitlist are on the waitlist.

## Outcomes

I hope to support all of you in:

-   using modern software with version control for collaboration;
-   recognizing problem patterns based on data semantics and research questions;
-   identifying and accessing resources for independent learning given a problem of interest;
-   communicating data analysis and/or research findings.

## Classroom environment

We are in an interactive classroom for a reason: to interact!

Let's acknowledge:

-   Preparations and areas of expertise vary widely among the class

-   It's okay not to know things

-   If you have a question, probably someone else does too

## Resources

All course content is hosted on our website

<https://pstat197.github.io/pstat197a/>

# Course content and structure

## Modules

The course is configured in modules defined by a dataset and questions (much like a project).

A module typically comprises:

-   One session on data introduction (lecture/discussion)

-   Two sessions on problem patterns and related methodology (lecture)

-   Two labs with related examples (section meeting)

-   One session on sharing data analysis results (discussion)

## Module content

The module datasets are currently as follows:

-   Class intake survey data (exploratory/descriptive analysis)

-   Biomarkers of autism (predictive modeling and variable selection)

-   Web fraud (text processing and deep learning)

-   Soil temperatures (correlated data)

## Group assignments

Each module you will be assigned a working group.

Your group's objective is to produce an analysis of the dataset:

-   **Reproduce** analysis presented/discussed in class meeting

-   **Extend** the analysis **by**

    -   applying an ***alternative method*** that addresses the same question(s)

    -   **or** addressing a ***corollary question***

## Vignettes

At the end of the class in place of a fifth module you will create a *vignette* (short demonstration) on a topic of interest.

-   present a use case

-   explain methodology

-   demonstrate implementation with example code

## Expectations and assessments

# Looking ahead

## Next time

We'll discuss:

-   data science as a discipline;

-   the research landscape;

-   systems and design thinking for data science.
